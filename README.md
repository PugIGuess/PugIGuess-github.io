# Purpose of this was for me to try and learn JS
# Initially I followed a basic youtube tutorial to get an idea on how JS worked, and it helped me lay out the js
# I then started the JS from scratch to see if I could get it to work, and added more.
# Will continue to try and balance it out and add more.
